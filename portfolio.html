                I didn't play Monopoly until the ripe old age of 19. The game is fun with friends (even if the game does take forever), but I was introduced to rules where players auctioned for property, which was easily the most fun part of the game.
                <br><br>
                This inspired me to create a strategy game based around auctioning called Turf Tactics (later renamed Gambit Gardens), which I held asynchronously for around 50 members on a discord server. The participants loved it so much they wanted me to make it real! So I set out to.

                I envisioned this sort of game as a cutesy, casual party board game, something to play with friends on the go. As such, this was my first attempt at making something mobile-first (and on top of that, portrait orientation as it's generally most comfortable for users), which came with its own issues.
                <br><br>
                The 6x6 board had to include a lot of key information, such as what plants were on the board, how many points they were worth, and so on.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore users would have to be able to see what abilities ALL the plants in their hand and on the board had, which there's not a lot of room left for after the board is on the screen.

                Plant cards have three pieces of key info: Their icon, how many points they are, and what ability they have. I compressed their icon & points into a small, simplified box, and had them show their ability as a banner notification-like display when tapped.
                <br><br>
                Alongside a myriad of other changes and changing the artstyle to have a more soft-border-like style, I was able to create a working demo for Gambit Gardens and have it tested by several dozen people via Discord.
                <br><br>
                This also ended up being my first foray into both a LOT of vector art & animation.

              <p>
                I think this game, while playable and fun, can be improved on a lot.
                <br><br>
                One UX problem left to solve is that players don't have a good idea of whose turn is next and whose turn it is, for example.
                <br><br>
                Beyond that, there are minor changes that would make the experience a whole lot better. Some animations (especially for Winter Melon, King Oyster Mushroom, and the Roses) are a little lazy and could use tweaking, and the small size of the animations prevents some finer details from showing up, which I need to adjust for. Another massive UX improvement is to actually animate out the plant abilities and their results to more clearly communicate what goes on during a turn.
                <br><br>
                These are some things I hope to work on before full release.
